Code-I-Learned-With
===================

These are projects I made that helped me understand the foundation of programming, as well as intermediate concepts.  The newer content are projects that have helped me learn advance concepts, such as databases, algorithmic design, object orientated programming, concurrent programming and operating systems.

There is some code here that I should be embarrassed of, but it was code I made when I first started, so I'm not ashamed of it.  It helps me see how far I've come.  In the beginning I use to use global variables a lot.  After I learned operating systems, and concurrent programming I learned to avoid it at all cost.  Now most of my work barely uses global variables.
