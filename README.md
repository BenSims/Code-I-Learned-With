# Code-I-Learned-With
These are projects I made that helped me understand the foundation of programming, 
as well as intermediate and advanced concepts.  Some of these are very simple; 
those are the ones I started with.  Later these projects got more complex, and at 
the same time my writing style began to evolve.  I worked out some bad habits, and 
improved the readability and functionality of my programs.
Old_Projects are projects I made to learn core concepts.  These concepts are OOP, 
Data Structures, Algorithms, and Advance Programming languages. 
Personal_Projects are ones that I did aside from class.  They are various games,
and tools that I use to in various ways.

For the old projects Java 7 and in 2015 Java 8.  For all the personal projects Java 8 is
required, and for the tests JUnit. 

I was told not long ago that my programming looks more practical based, than
theoretical based.  I did not like that commit.  I didn’t make A’s in all my classes
for nothing.  But looking back at my code, yes I don’t often apply what I learned
into my personal projects, and that is my fault.  So I took one of my old assignments,
made it so that it does not meet the graded requirements, but in a good way.  And this
is my new project, the Computer Science Cave.  Under that folder I will display all my
knowledge of Computer Science.  I’ll be making data structures of various kinds
(Graphs, Trees, Stacks, Queues, ect), I’ll be displaying various algorithms that do
key things (Sorting, Calculating, ect), and I’ll be showing off my current writing
style.  I’m learning JUnit, and I’ll include tests for all methods I make.
