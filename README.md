These are projects I made that helped me understand the foundation of programming, 
as well as intermediate and advanced concepts.  Some of these are very simple; 
those are the ones I started with.  Later these projects got more complex, and at 
the same time my writing style began to evolve.  I worked out some bad habits, and 
improved the readability and functionality of my programs.
